        <p>With over 15 years of experience in the pet training industry, 
           I would love to share my experience with you and your family pet. My passion is developing long, enriching relationships between pets and their people through training . Wouldn’t you love to communicate with your pet more clearly, while developing the skills you can apply to all future pets? I’m here to help make that happen!
        </p>
        <p>Honest To Dog was inspired by my desire to provide animal training and behavior consulting based in the science of learning, with emphasis on the welfare of the pets in our care. To achieve this I continue to pursue the best in animal training education.
