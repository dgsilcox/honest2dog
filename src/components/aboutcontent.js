        <p>
        Our top priority at Honest To Dog is making sure our pet clients are focused and engaged - even having fun while they’re being trained! That’s because a positive, fear-free environment allows pets to respond better to training, retain their new skills and actually begin to choose appropriate behavior on their own.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before we start training, Honest To Dog looks at all aspects of your life and your pet’s. That includes your schedule and lifestyle, the areas of your home that are open to your pet, where they eat, sleep and play, and even your pastimes and how you’d like to get your pets involved. With that information in mind, we custom-design a training plan that provides real-life solutions for your real-life needs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Honest To Dog can also connect you with trusted pet resources in the RVA community, such as veterinarians, groomers, pet sitters and daycare centers.
